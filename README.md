# 💻 Applications & Algorithms
This repository contains some little algorithms that I implemented since I start programming.

## 🛠️ Applications Overview
* Strong Password Checker: This algorithm is designed to assess the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters), and repeating characters.
* OOP Applications: This section comprises Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) applications that showcase how OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation can be applied in real-world scenarios.
* Validate Sudoku NxN: This algorithm verifies the validity of a Sudoku puzzle of size NxN. It checks if the puzzle adheres to Sudoku rules, including no repeating values in rows, columns, or NxN regions.
* Sort By Name: This algorithm is designed to sort a collection of code comments alphabetically by the author's name or any specified criterion.
* Comment Strips: Algorithm is a tool for organizing code comments within a codebase. It parses through code files and extracts comments.

## 🛡️ Key Features
* Enhances Security: Ensures that passwords meet robust security requirements, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Allows flexibility in defining password policies to align with specific security needs.
* Modularity: Encourages code organization into reusable, self-contained classes, leading to maintainable and scalable code.
* Abstraction: Promotes a high level of abstraction, making code more understandable and adaptable to changes.
* Encapsulation: Protects data integrity by encapsulating data and methods within classes.
* Logic and Constraint Solving: Demonstrates a real-world application of constraint solving through code, a fundamental problem-solving skill.
